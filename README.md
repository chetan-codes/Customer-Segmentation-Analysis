# Customer Segmentation Analysis

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Analysis repository! This project focuses on conducting descriptive analysis on customer data and implementing various versions of the K-means algorithm to gain visual insights and improve segmentation accuracy.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business intelligence, helping businesses understand their customers better and tailor their strategies accordingly. In this project, we explored a dataset containing information about customers and used K-means clustering to group similar customers together based on certain features.

## Project Highlights

- Descriptive Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset, including summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns.
- K-means Algorithm Implementation: Implemented several versions of the K-means algorithm, including standard K-means, K-means++, and Mini-batch K-means.
- Visual Insights and Segmentations: Visualized the results of the clustering algorithms to understand the structure of the data and evaluate segmentation accuracy.

## Project Files

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for descriptive analysis.
- `kmeans_implementation.py`: Python script implementing various versions of the K-means algorithm.
- `visualization.py`: Python script for visualizing clustering results.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation of the project.

## Results

The project successfully achieved the following outcomes:

- Identified distinct customer segments based on their characteristics.
- Visualized the segmentation results to provide insights for marketing strategies.
- Improved segmentation accuracy through fine-tuning of K-means algorithms.
